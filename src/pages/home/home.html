      <h3>WHAT IS IONIC</h3>
      <p>Ionic Framework is an open source SDK that enables developers to build
        high-quality mobile apps using familiar web technologies (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript).<br><br>
        Ionic is focused mainly on the look and feel, or the UI interaction, of an app. This means 
        that it’s not a replacement for Cordova or your favorite JavaScript framework. Instead, Ionic 
        fits in well with these projects, in order to simplify one big part of your app development process: 
        the front-end.<br><br>
        With one codebase, you can have three apps running on Android, iOS and Windows.<br><br>

      <h3>HOW IS IONIC LISENSED</h3>
      <p>Ionic is completely free and open source, released under the permissive MIT license, 
        which means you can use Ionic in personal or commercial projects for free. 
        For example, MIT is the same license used by such popular projects as jQuery and Ruby on Rails.</p>
    
        <h3>WHAT IS THE IONIC CLI?</h3>
      <p>The CLI, or command line interface, is a tool that provides a number of helpful commands to Ionic developers. 
        In addition to installing and updating Ionic, the CLI comes with a built-in development server, build and debugging tools, 
        and much more. If you are using Ionic Pro, the CLI can be used to export code and even interact with your account programmatically.</p>
    
      
        <h3>WHAT ARE COMPONENTS</h3>
        <p>Components in Ionic are reusable UI elements that serve as the building blocks for your mobile app. 
          Components are made up of HTML, CSS, and sometimes JavaScript. <br>Every Ionic component adapts to the platform
           on which your app is running. We call this Platform Continuity and go more in depth on how it works in Theming.</p>
    
      <h3>WHAT IS THEMING</h3>
      <p>Themes are sets of styles that get applied to an app. Ionic uses a light theme by default, but it also comes with a dark theme. 
        In addition to theming, Ionic’s Platform Continuity enables components to have platform-specific styles. This means the app’s styles 
        will change based on the platform (iOS, Android, etc.) on which it’s being run, offering your users an experience with which they’re familiar.</p>
